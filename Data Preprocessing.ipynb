It\\'s a shame because the man\\'s slain He got caught in the chains of his own game How can I feel guilty after all the things they did to me? Sweated me, hunted me, trapped in my own community One day I\\'m gonna bust, blow up on this society Why did you lie to me? I couldn\\'t find a trace of equality Worked me like a slave while they laid back Homie don\\'t play that, it\\'s time I let \\'em suffer the payback I\\'m tryin\\' to avoid physical contact I can\\'t hold back, it\\'s time to attack jack They got me trapped  [Chorus: Shock G & 2Pac] Uh uh, they can\\'t keep the black man down They got me trapped Naw, they can\\'t keep the black man down Trapped Uh uh, they can\\'t keep the black man down Trapped Naw, they can\\'t keep the black man down  [Verse 3: 2Pac] Now I\\'m trapped, and walkin\\' for my getaway All I need is a G and somewhere safe to stay Can\\'t use the phone \\'cause I\\'m sure someone is tapping in Did it before, ain\\'t scared to use my gat again I look back in hindsight the fight was irrelevant But now he\\'s the Devil\\'s friend, too late to be tellin\\' him He shot first and I\\'ll be damned if I run away Homie is done away, I should\\'ve put my gun away I wasn\\'t thinkin\\', all I heard was the ridicule Girlies was laughin\\', Tup saying \"Damn homies is dissin\\' you\" I fired my weapon, started steppin\\' in the hurricane I got shot, so I dropped feelin\\' a burst of pain Got to my feet, couldn\\'t see nothin\\' but bloody blood Now I\\'m a fugitive to be hunted like a murderer Ran through an alley, still lookin\\' for my getaway Copper say, \"Freeze, or you\\'ll be dead today.\" Trapped in a corner, dark and I couldn\\'t see the light Thoughts in my mind was the nine and a better life What do I do? Live my life in a prison cell? I\\'d rather die than be trapped in a living Hell They got me trapped  [Chorus: Shock G & 2Pac] Uh uh, they can\\'t keep the black man down They got me trapped Naw, they can\\'t keep the black man down Trapped Uh uh, they can\\'t keep the black man down You know they got me trapped Naw, they can\\'t keep the black man down Trapped  [Outro] \"Yo ya\\'ll seen 2Pac man?

Unconditional love (no doubt) Talkin\\' about the stuff that don\\'t wear off, it don\\'t fade It\\'ll last for all these crazy days, these crazy nights Whether you wrong or you right A motherfucker still love you, still feel you Still there for you, no matter what (hehe) You will always be in my heart with unconditional love  [Verse 1] Come listen to my truest thoughts, my truest feelings All my peers doin\\' years beyond drug dealing How many caskets can we witness Before we see it\\'s hard to live this life without God? So we must ask forgiveness Ask Mama why I got this urge to die Witness the tears fallin\\' free from my eyes before she could reply Though we were born without a silver spoon My broken down TV show cartoons in my living room (hey) One day I hope to make it, a player in this game Mama, don\\'t cry, long as we try maybe things change Perhaps it\\'s just a fantasy A life where we don’t need no welfare and share with our whole family Maybe it\\'s me that caused it, the fightin\\' and the hurtin\\' In my room cryin\\' because I didn\\'t wanna be a burden Watch Mama open up her arms to hug me And I ain\\'t worried \\'bout a damn thing, with unconditional love  [Chorus] In this game, the lesson\\'s in your eyes to see Though things change, the future\\'s still inside of me We must remember that tomorrow comes after the dark So you will always be in my heart, with unconditional love In this game, the lesson\\'s in your eyes to see Though things change, the future\\'s still inside of me We must remember that tomorrow comes after the dark So you will always be in my heart, with unconditional love  [Verse 2] Just got the message, you\\'ve been callin\\' all week Been out here hustlin\\' on these streets Ain\\'t had a chance to speak But you know, with you and me it\\'s all G We could never be enemies \\'Cause you\\'ve been such a good friend to me Where would I be without my dogs? No wonder why when times get hard \\'Cause it ain\\'t easy bein\\' who we are Driven by my ambitions, desire higher positions So I proceed to make G\\'s eternally And my mission is to be more than just a rap musician The elevation of today\\'s generation, if I could make \\'em listen Prison ain\\'t what we need, no longer stuck in greed Time to plan, strategize, my family\\'s gotta eat We work somethin\\' out of nothin\\' No pleasure in the sufferin\\' Neighborhood would be good if they could cut out all the bustin\\' The liquor and the weed, the cussin\\' Sendin\\' love out to my block The struggle never stops (unconditional love)  [Chorus] In this game, the lesson\\'s in your eyes to see Though things change, the future\\'s still inside of me We must remember that tomorrow comes after the dark So you will always be in my heart, with unconditional love In this game, the lesson\\'s in your eyes to see Though things change, the future\\'s still inside of me We must remember that tomorrow comes after the dark So you will always be in my heart, with unconditional love  [Verse 3] I\\'ll probably never understand your ways With everyday I swear I hear you tryin\\' to change your ways While gettin\\' paid at the same time Just had a baby with the same eyes Somethin\\' inside, please let me die, these are strange times How come I never made it? Maybe it\\'s the way I played it in my heart I knew one day I gotta be a star My hopes and all my wishes, so many vivid pictures And all the currency I\\'ll never even get to see This fast life soon shatters, \\'cause after all the lights and screams nothin\\' but my dreams matter Hopin\\' for better days, maybe a peaceful night Baby, don\\'t cry, \\'cause everything gon\\' be alright Just lay your head on my shoulder Don\\'t worry \\'bout a thing, baby girl, I\\'m a soldier (huh) Never treated me bad, no matter who I was You still came with that unconditional love  [Chorus] (repeat to fade) In this game, the lesson\\'s in your eyes to see Though things change, the future\\'s still inside of me We must remember that tomorrow comes after the dark So you will always be in my heart, with unconditional love In this game, the lesson\\'s in your eyes to see Though things change, the future\\'s still inside of me We must remember that tomorrow comes after the dark So you will always be in my heart, with unconditional love     [Verse 1: 2Pac] When I was young me and my mama had beef Seventeen years old kicked out on the streets Though back at the time, I never thought I\\'d see her face Ain\\'t a woman alive that could take my mama\\'s place Suspended from school and scared to go home, I was a fool With the big boys, breakin all the rules I shed tears with my baby sister Over the years we was poorer than the other little kids And even though we had different daddy\\'s, the same drama When things went wrong we\\'d blame mama I reminisce on the stress I caused, it was hell Huggin on my mama from a jail cell And who\\'d think in elementary? Hey! I see the penitentiary, one day And runnin from the police, that\\'s right Mama catch me, put a whoopin to my backside And even as a crack fiend, mama You always was a black queen, mama I finally understand For a woman it ain\\'t easy tryin to raise a man You always was committed A poor single mother on welfare, tell me how you did it There\\'s no way I can pay you back But the plan is to show you that I understand You are appreciated  [Hook: Anthony Hamilton & 2Pac] Dear mama Don\\'t you know I love you? Dear mama Place no one above you (Dear mama) Oh mama, I appreciate you Although my shadow\\'s gone I will never leave you  [Verse 2: 2Pac] Now ain\\'t nobody tell us it was fair No love from my daddy cause the coward wasn\\'t there He passed away and I didn\\'t cry, cause my anger Wouldn\\'t let me feel for a stranger They say I\\'m wrong and I\\'m heartless, but all along I was lookin for a father he was gone I hung around with the Thugs, and even though they sold drugs They showed a young brother love I moved out and started really hangin I needed money of my own so I started slangin I ain\\'t guilty cause, even though I sell rocks It feels good puttin money in your mailbox I love payin rent when the rent\\'s due I hope ya got the diamond necklace that I sent to you Cause when I was low you was there for me And never left me alone because you cared for me And I could see you comin home after work late You\\'re in the kitchen tryin to fix us a hot plate Ya just workin with the scraps you was given And mama made miracles every Thanksgiving But now the road got rough, you\\'re alone You\\'re tryin to raise two bad kids on your own And there\\'s no way I can pay you back But my plan is to show you that I understand You are appreciated  [Hook: Anthony Hamilton & 2Pac] Dear mama Don\\'t you know I love you? Dear mama Place no one above you (And dear mama) Oh mama, I appreciate you Although my shadow\\'s gone I will never leave you  [Verse 3: 2Pac] Pour out some liquor and I reminisce, cause through the drama I can always depend on my mama And when it seems that I\\'m hopeless You say the words that can get me back in focus When I was sick as a little kid To keep me happy there\\'s no limit to the things you did And all my childhood memories Are full of all the sweet things you did for me And even though I act crazy I gotta thank the Lord that you made me There are no words that can express how I feel You never kept a secret, always stayed real And I appreciate, how you raised me And all the extra love that you gave me I wish I could take the pain away If you can make it through the night there\\'s a brighter day Everything will be alright if you hold on It\\'s a struggle everyday, gotta roll on And there\\'s no way I can pay you back But my plan is to show you that I understand You are appreciated  [Hook: Anthony Hamilton & 2Pac] Dear mama Don\\'t you know I love you? Dear mama Place no one above you (Dear mama) Oh mama, I appreciate you Although my shadow\\'s gone I will never leave you  [Outro: Anthony Hamilton] I appreciate you I love you I need you Oh mama I love you Appreciate you I need you Oh mama *fading away*     [Intro: 2Pac] Resist the temptation This song go out to the Underground Railroad.. Digital Underground..  [Verse 1: 2Pac] Resist the temptation of the beast You slip and loose your grip, and forever fall asleep The venom is contagious, be wary of its spell What you thought would be heaven, turns out to be hell I wonder if she knows, the devil\\'s taking off her clothes Deep into her soul, slow, now he\\'s in control Poppa\\'s doing worse, a victim of his deadly curse Wouldn\\'t be the first, to leave the ghetto in a hearse Oh and how it hurts, the children pay the biggest price Never get the chance to grow up with a happy life Blame it on the rock, but we know that\\'s a bunch of crap Someone from the top, supplying us with plenty crack Keep \\'em in a daze, don\\'t let them see the other way Let \\'em all get paid, won\\'t live to see another day See, they never got a breath of the sunshine Now the kid\\'s addicted and only hit it one time We\\'re destined to be dead as a nation Don\\'t let it come to this, resist the temptation  [Hook: Amel Larrieux] From pyramid top to bottom of bowl From whips and locks to fist and afro We dug too deep to give up this gold Don\\'t be bought, and you won\\'t be sold Running on empty, you ain\\'t gon\\' go Running on empty, lead you to nowhere We fact, nobody can lie So resist the temptation  [Verse 2: 2Pac] Gamble for your soul with the devil You wonder how low, can you go, before you finally reach the lowest level As everybody sit and stares There\\'s no use looking in your eyes cause there isn\\'t anybody there And though it may make you wanna cry Got you stealing from your family and you don\\'t even know why I guess you think they\\'ll understand You feel cold, cause you sold your soul to the dopeman Oh now there\\'s no turning back, in fact It\\'s decided, that would live and die for the crack You got no friends cause you cheated \\'em all Feel lonely, low, defeated and small No one was there when I took the wrong path And nobody\\'d care if I died in a blood bath But is this my destiny? Tell the lord they got my mind, but he can have the rest of me Cause I\\'m ready to end it all One bullet to the brain, forgive my sins and all I didn\\'t mean to be a bother A failure as a son, a husband and a father I wish I could turn back the time Go back and find, why I let it crack my mind And my only explanation, it came to this Resist the temptation  [Hook: Amel Larrieux] From pyramid top to bottom of bowl From whips and locks to fist and afro We dug too deep to give up this gold Don\\'t be bought, and you won\\'t be sold Running on empty, you ain\\'t gon\\' go Running on empty, lead you to nowhere We fact, nobody can lie So resist the temptation  [Verse 3: 2Pac] Your death left family behind Your wife and your son find a gun, and pieces of daddy\\'s mind On the door and on the floor Now her husband is dead, what else is she living for? So now she picks up the gun Now son is the only one Grows up in adoption homes Gets older, bolder, and cold cause he\\'s left alone To him, nothing is funny Mind set on one thing, making his money Since I was left with no hope I want money and gold ropes and so I slang dope Now I\\'m the neighborhood dopeman And as long cause they smoking I\\'ll never be broke man I live the life of a trifle Following a cycle, so I\\'m just a psycho But if I had a better life I would have lived a good life and did more things right Hard to resist temptation With all the aggravation and the frustration Of living in the ghetto Your mind gets twisted, just like a pretzel So it\\'s time that I check out But one nosy cop, just won\\'t let me get out They got me trapped once again With a choice: shoot the cop, or live life in the pen I can\\'t stand the frustration Resist the temptation  [Hook: Amel Larrieux] From pyramid top to bottom of bowl From whips and locks to fist and afro We dug too deep to give up this gold Don\\'t be bought, and you won\\'t be sold Running on empty, you ain\\'t gon\\' go Running on empty, lead you to nowhere We fact, nobody can lie So resist the temptation  [Outro:

I don\\'t trip or let it fade me From out of the fryin\\' pan we jump into another form of slavery Even now I get discouraged Wonder, if they take it all back, will I still keep the courage? I refuse to be a role model I set goals, take control, drink out my own bottles I make mistakes but learn from every one And when it\\'s said and done, I bet this brother be a better one If I upset you, don\\'t stress Never forget that God isn\\'t finished with me yet I feel His hand on my brain When I write rhymes I go blind and let the Lord do his thang But am I less holy \\'Cause I chose to puff a blunt and drink a beer with my homies? Before we find world peace We gotta find peace and end the war in the streets My ghetto gospel  [Chorus: Elton John] Those who wish to follow me (Yeah, ghetto gospel) I welcome with my hands And the red sun sinks at last Into the hills of gold And peace to this young warrior Without the sound of guns  [Outro: 2Pac] Lord, can you hear me speak? To pay the price of bein\\' hellbound     [Intro: Dave Hollister] Brenda\\'s got a baby Brenda\\'s got a baby  [Verse: 2Pac] I hear Brenda\\'s got a baby, but Brenda\\'s barely got a brain A damn shame, the girl can hardly spell her name \"That\\'s not our problem, that\\'s up to Brenda\\'s family\" Well, let me show you how it affects our whole community Now Brenda really never knew her moms And her dad was a junkie, puttin\\' death into his arms It\\'s sad, \\'cause I bet Brenda doesn\\'t even know Just \\'cause you\\'re in the ghetto doesn\\'t mean you can\\'t grow But oh, that\\'s a thought, my own revelation Do whatever it takes to resist the temptation Brenda got herself a boyfriend Her boyfriend was her cousin, now let\\'s watch the joy end She tried to hide her pregnancy, from her family Who really didn\\'t care to see, or give a damn if she Went out and had a church of kids As long as when the check came they got first dibs Now Brenda\\'s belly\\'s gettin\\' bigger But no one seems to notice any change in her figure She\\'s twelve years old and she\\'s havin\\' a baby In love with a molester, who\\'s sexin\\' her crazy And yet and she thinks that he\\'ll be with her forever And dreams of a world where the two of them are together Whatever, he left her and she had the baby solo She had it on the bathroom floor and didn\\'t know, so She didn\\'t know what to throw away and what to keep She wrapped the baby up and threw him in a trash heap I guess she thought she\\'d get away, wouldn\\'t hear the cries She didn\\'t realize how much the little baby had her eyes Now the baby\\'s in the trash heap, bawlin\\' Momma can\\'t help her, but it hurts to hear her callin\\' Brenda wants to run away Momma say \"you makin\\' me lose pay There\\'s social workers here every day\" Now Brenda\\'s gotta make her own way Can\\'t go to her family, they won\\'t let her stay No money, no babysitter, she couldn\\'t keep a job She tried to sell crack but end up gettin\\' robbed So now, what\\'s next? There ain\\'t nothin\\' left to sell So she sees sex as a way of leavin\\' hell It\\'s payin\\' the rent, so she really can\\'t complain Prostitute, found slain, and Brenda\\'s her name She\\'s got a baby     [Intro: 2Pac] Shit, tired of gettin\\' shot at Tired of gettin\\' chased by the police and arrested Niggas need a spot where we can kick it A spot where we belong, that\\'s just for us Niggas ain\\'t gotta get all dressed up and be Hollywood Y\\'knahmean? Where do niggas go when we die? Ain\\'t no heaven for a thug nigga That\\'s why we go to thug mansion That\\'s the only place where thugs get in free And you gotta be a G, at thug mansion  [Verse 1: 2Pac] A place to spend my quiet nights, time to unwind So much pressure in this life of mine, I cry at times I once contemplated suicide, and woulda tried But when I held that 9, all I could see was my mama\\'s eyes No one knows my struggle, they only see the trouble Not knowin\\' it\\'s hard to carry on when no one loves you Picture me inside the misery of poverty No man alive has ever witnessed struggles I survived Prayin\\' hard for better days, promise to hold on Me and my dawgs ain\\'t have a choice but to roll on We found a finally spot to kick it Where we can drink liquor and no one bickers over trick shit A spot where we can smoke in peace, and even though we G\\'s We still visualize places that we can roll in peace And in my mind\\'s eye, I see this place the players go and pass it I got a spot for us all, so we can ball, at thug\\'s mansion  [Chorus: J. Phoenix] Every corner, every city There\\'s a place where life\\'s a little easy Little Hennessy, laid back and cool Every hour, ‘cause it\\'s all good Leave all the stress from the world outside Every wrong done will be alright Nothing but peace, love And street passion Every ghetto needs a thug mansion  [Verse 2: 2Pac] Will I survive all the fights and the darkness? Trouble sparks, they tell me: \"Home is where the heart is.\" Dear departed, I shed tattooed tears And couldn\\'t sleep good for multiple years Witness peers catch gunshots; nobody cares Seen the politicians ban us, they\\'d rather see us locked in chains Please explain why they can\\'t stand us Is there a way for me to change? Or am I just a victim of things I did to maintain? I need a place to rest my head With the little bit of homeboys that remains ‘Cause all the rest dead; is there a spot for us to roll? If you find it, I\\'ll be right behind ya, show me and I\\'ll go How can I be peaceful? I\\'m comin\\' from the bottom Watch my daddy scream \"Peace!\" while the other man shot him I need a house that\\'s full of love, when I need to escape The deadly places slingin\\' drugs, in thug\\'s mansion  [Chorus: J. Phoenix] Every corner, every city There\\'s a place where life\\'s a little easy Little Hennessy, laid back and cool Every hour, ‘cause it\\'s all good Leave all the stress from the world outside Every wrong done will be alright Nothing but peace, love And street passion Every ghetto needs a thug mansion  [Verse 3: 2Pac] Dear Mama, don\\'t cry, your baby boy\\'s doin\\' good Tell the homies I\\'m in Heaven and they ain\\'t got hoods Seen a show with Marvin Gaye last night, it had me shook Drinkin\\' peppermint Schnapps, with Jackie Wilson and Sam Cooke Then some lady named Billie Holiday sang Sittin\\' there kickin\\' it with Malcolm \\'til the day came Little Latasha sho\\' grown Tell the lady in the liquor store that she\\'s forgiven, so come home Maybe in time you\\'ll understand Only God can save us, when Miles Davis cuttin\\' lose with the band Just think of all the people that you knew in the past That passed on, they in Heaven, found peace at last Picture a place that they exist, together There has to be a place better than this, in Heaven So right before I sleep, dear God, what I\\'m askin\\' Remember this face, save me a place in thug\\'s mansion  [Chorus: J. Phoenix & (2Pac)] Every corner, every city There\\'s a place where life\\'s a little easy (Thugz mansion) Little Hennessy, laid back and cool Every hour, ‘cause it\\'s all good Leave all the stress from the world outside Every wrong done will be alright Nothing but peace, love And street passion Every ghetto needs a thug mansion     [Intro: 2Pac & J.

[2Pac] I know this girl and her name is Minnie Livin\\' in the projects didn\\'t own a penny Met her at a school dance so I took a chance Walked her to the parkin\\' lot for a little romance Got to my car, put the key in the ignition Turned on the slow jams, I was on a mission I was catchin\\' wild things like the chicken pox I was \"J\" and knockin\\' boots right down the socks She was freaky and wild, oh man could I call it? But when I dropped her off, she had stole my wallet I couldn\\'t quite believe that why a hoocher-coocher? But that was my first experience with MINNIE THE MOOCHER!!  [2Pac] Minnie the Moocher was a legend on the block I\\'m from A dream girl to many brothers, but true to none Her reputation was enormous - a real go getter And once a brother met her, he wanted to get with her Maybe it was her smile, her personality or The way she shook her shimmy or the clothes she wore But whatever it was, Minnie the Moocher was an expert Real heart-breaker, but never get hurt She had this boyfriend, his name was Diamond Helpin\\' Minnie out with the little social climbin\\' Met with Politicians, peace to many others Suddenly and instantly, they became her lovers She took the power that they possessed And Minnie did it all without gettin\\' undressed Minnie dissed Diamond sayin\\' that he could not live with her But he wanted payment for the things he did for her He grabbed the gun sittin\\' on the nightstand Minnie held the bullets, put the pistol in her right hand She was a legend to everyone who knew her That\\'s is my memory of Minnie the Moocher  [Ray Tyson] Minnie had a boyfriend, a gambler Addicted to poker, an alcoholic, a basehead, crack smoker He took her to Harlem, and all around Chinatown He bought some base, a pipe a tape of hard-rap sounds She was an addict, tired of the static and poverty Sick of the same ghetto misery See, Minnie was a young kid lookin\\' for excitement Smokey was a hoodlum, headin\\' for inditement Then one day their relationship stopped When Smokey was killed by the M-I-C-Cops Minnie was hurt, lost without a clue To her, there was no chance of gettin\\' somebody new So she walked home sadly, as bad as it seems She cried herself to sleep to find the man of her dreams  [Ray Tyson] She had dreams and schemes about the King of Sweden He gave her things that this girl was much needin\\' A plush house made of gold and steel A diamond car with a platt in the wheel Now you might think this is a lot of stuff But to Minnie this was not enough He bought a stable, full of thorough-bred race horses His meal she ate was a dozen courses She had a fortune in nickels and dimes And she sat around and counted it a billion times She had bank, yeah Minnie was clockin\\' Had every sucker in the neighborhood JOCKIN\\'!! She would walk by tryin\\' all to wink her eye Then she dissin\\', with zero reply     Verse 1 -  2pac (DJ Bizzy)  They finally did it (what\\'s that?)

It\\'d be the first time I lost But if I beat \\'em it\\'d finally prove that I\\'m the boss I grabbed my leather jacket Walked through the streets Was hopin and payin Strictly dope won\\'t get beat I begin to get hyped I was ready to fight Yo I was confident that I win To hell with the mic! I hop on to the stage Dizzy started the beat The sucka shivered Because he tasted defeat Then I signaled to Dizzy Bust a rhyme wit my head Perpetrator fell back (HA!) And then he was dead I was happy as hell Cause I was lucky that night Put my hand in my pocket And there was my mic Haha  (now why you tell em that?)

uh)  [Verse 1: Talib Kweli] Pack your cannons we outlandishly brandish the weapons Meet Jamaican like you god {U-god?} and \\'em handing you lessons We learn a lot from the 60\\'s like glaring 13 necks Mainly the niggas get shot for flaring out their larynx And get to speakin\\' on a conditions of black people That\\'s illegal they enforce it with the force that\\'s lethal Make you wanna grab a gun and throw the all black gear on Head to congress exercising your constitutional right to bear arms Leather jackets and glasses and you can tell it\\'s us The FBI probably bust a nut if we self

Medgar Evers, Martin, and my brother Malcom Sometimes we be sittin and wishing for another outcome My head be spinning, it be full of why\\'s and the how come\\'s The value of life is so cheap if your

nigga, you the opposite of Huey P Don\\'t be confusing me with haters, player Get your paper, just show respect to the folks who made you (yeah) Blessed by the creator so give money nigga Just don\\'t bring a plate of food around a hungry nigga Out on these streets the police is killing I\\'m spilling out my heart on these beats so I can feed my children (yeah) Disrespect and I\\'m a give you a bar to save your life Because we don\\'t need no more fallen stars  [Hook] Now before you see God, or stand before Allah You could learn from the stars that fall outta the sky Everybody act hard, like

floor Word, rock on, throw the 2Pac on He\\'s not gone, you hear his influence in pop songs Shine brighter than those Vegas lights Illuminating that Vegas night to the party after the fight \\'til the

It\\'s a lot of responsibility But we standing on the shoulders of our ancestors So I bear that burden, throw it on my back     * Poems written by Shakur as ~ interpreted by other artists  [Ludacris] Yes, sir This is Ludacris In a recite to you an original poem written by my man 2Pac Shakur Entitled; in the depths of solitude And it goes with a something like this Eh, ehhm Yeah  I exsist in the depths of solitude Ponderin my true goal Tryin to find piece of mine And still preserve my soul Constantly learnin to be accepted And from all recieve respect Never compromising but sometimes risky And that is my only regret How can there be peace A young heart with an old soul How can I be in the depths of solitude When there are to inside of me This duo within me causes the perfect oppotunity To learn and live twice as fast As those who accepts simplicity  Yes If you\\'re reading between the lines you can understand exactly what my man 2Pac shakur was talking about mayne You see in or outside the music industry Everyone has heard the expression as lonely on top Well you know Pac was on top It\\'s only naturally that he exsisted In the depths of solitude Of course he was a young heart with an old soul And individual with, what was a way ahead of his time And sometimes when you are ahead of youre time You do wonder what your true goal in life is When you get so ovius critisising and put down for teaching What you\\'ve learned to others And doing what you feel is the rigth thing to do So with that Pac like all soldiers fought, to be accepted Specially by those who rejected him the most And even if you didn\\'t like him You had to respect him See nobodys perfect And off course everyone makes mistakes But experience is the best teaching, if you ask me So its important to learn from each mistake And try hard, not to make the same one twice His only regret was making the mistake of being too overdemanding at times But it was the wild outrages Pac Mixed with the sensitive love in Pac That made him almost the perfect person Also made him learn and live twice as fast And I\\'m sure, he would rather walk through life With these multived dimensional personalities Than to except being one side than simplistic Any day.. So being in the depths of solitude, if you ask me Is were the true heroes of our times stay 2Pac Shakur, in our hearts and our minds forever Rest In Peace, live in harmony...

(what?!) She didn\\'t listen, had sex, watch her belly raise (hey) Got violated by someone she dated If this is fate, I\\'d hate to see the seeds she created, and so we waited Though it takes time to build a body and a mind She reclines nine months then finally it\\'s time What do we find?, little growin\\' boy of mine With a tortured soul, addicted to a life of crime Had no time for the growin\\' stage He learned his values on the streets at an early age Watch for police, don\\'t come home (why?) Cuz Mama\\'s actin\\' crazy at the hospit-al \\'bout to have another baby Like a rose from the concrete, growin\\' within Blessed with twins how the hell can Mama raise three men?

I exist in the depths of solitude pondering my true goal Trying 2 find peace of mind and still preserve my soul Constantly yearning 2 be accepted and from all receive respect Never compromising but sometimes risky and that is my only regret A young heart with an old soul how can there be peace How can I be in the depths of solitude when there R 2 inside of me This duo within me causes the perfect opportunity 2 learn and live twice as fast as those who accept simplicity     Sometimes when I\\'m alone I cry because I\\'m on my own The tears I cry R bitter and warm They flow with life but take no form I cry because my heart is torn and I find it difficult 2 carry on If I had an ear 2 confide in I would cry among my treasured friends But who do u know that stops that long To help another carry on The world moves fast and it would rather pass u by than 2 stop and c what makes u cry It\\'s painful and sad and sometimes I cry and no one cares about why.     My child is out there somewhere under the skies above waiting anxiously 4 u and me 2 bless it with our love A part of me a part of u and a part of this love we share will protect my unborn child who lives dormant out there somewhere Sometimes in my dreams I imagine what it would be like How could I properly guide him when even I don\\'t know what\\'s right Whether he is born in wealth or poverty there will be no deficiency in love I welcome this gift of life given from GOD under the skies above     Life through my bloodshot eyes would scare a square 2 death poverty, murder, violence and never a moment 2 rest Fun and games R few but treasured like gold 2 me cuz I realize that I must return 2 my spot in poverty But mock my words when I say my heart will not exist unless my destiny comes through and puts an end 2 all of this     When your heart turns cold it causes your soul 2 freeze Spreads throughout your spirit Like a ruthless feeling disease The walls that once were down Now stand firm and tall Safe from hate/love, pain/joy until u feel nothing at all When ure heart turns cold a baby\\'s cry means nothing A dead corpse is trivial Mothers neglecting children is daily Lonliness becomes your routine friend Death seems like tranquility Sleeping is never pleasant if you even sleep at all u forget ideals and turn off the reason 2 make sure the product is sold You don\\'t understand how I behave Just wait till your heart turns Cold!     Please wake me when I\\'m free I cannot bear captivity where my culture I\\'m told holds no significance I\\'ll wither and die in ignorance But my inner eye can c a race who reigned as kings in another place the green of trees were rich and full and every man spoke of beautiful men and women together as equals War was gone because all was peaceful But now like a nightmare I wake 2 c That I live like a prisoner of poverty Please wake me when I\\'m free I cannot bear captivity 4 I would rather be stricken blind than 2 live without expression of mind     From my mind 2 the depths of my soul I yearn 2 achieve all of my goals And all of my free time will be spent On the 1\\'s I miss I will lament  I am not a perfectionist But still I seek perfection I am not a great romantic But yet I yearn 4 affection  Eternally my mind will produce ways 2 put my talents 2 use and when I\\'m done no matter where I\\'ve been I\\'ll yearn 2 do it all again.     I\\'m Down with strictly Dope \"So\" That means I\\'m more than u can handle \"Hot\" I\\'m hotter than the wax from a candle \"Him\" that\\'s Roc he\\'s my microphone companion \"Lyrics\" full of knowledge truth and understanding \"Hobbies\" rapping is my only recreation \"retire\" u must be on some kind of medication \"why\" because I\\'ll never loosen up my mic grip \"Drugs\" never cuz I\\'m living on the right tip \"sex\" only with my girl because I love her \"Babies\" impossible I always use a rubber \"Bored\" rarely cuz I\\'m keeping myself busy \"Scratch\" nah I leave the cutting up 2 Dize \"Dize?\" yeh that\\'s my D.J. he\\'s the greatest \"Word\" nah he\\'s paying me 2 say this \"the mind\" is something that I cultivate and treasure \"Thanks\" you\\'re welcome and besides it was my Pleasure     everyone knows ure Face The world screams ure name Never again R u alone     Secrets R hidden within the clouds of Darkness, And in this place no one Dares 2 Breathe in Fear of self-expression It has been this way forever and a day until she came 2 shine with a spark of innocence and questions only 2 be answered with Darkness Not just Darkness but the silent kind that steals your soul and kills your mind There was no compassion for this thriving star only exploitations and confused jealousy u saw no hope and brought the end Never acknowledging the star within     a creative heart, obsessed with satisfying This dormant and uncaring society u have given them the stars at night and u have given them Bountiful Bouquets of Sunflowers But 4 u there is only contempt and though u pour yourself into that frame and present it so proudly this world could not accept your masterpieces from the heart  So on that starry night u gave 2 us and u took away from us The one thing we never acknowledged your Life     If in my quest 2 achieve my goals I stumble or crumble and lose my soul Those that knew me would easily co-sign There was never a life as hard as mine No father - no money - no chance and no guide I only follow my voice inside If it guides me wrong and I do not win I\\'ll learn from mistakes and try 2 achieve again.     I know not what I search 4 But I know I have yet 2 find it, Because it is invisible 2 the eye My heart must search 4 it blinded.  And if by chance I find it, Will I know my mission is achieved? Can one come 2 conclusions, Before the question is conceived?  Just as no one knows what lies beyond the shore, I will never find the answer 2 what it is that I search 4     against an attacker I will boldly take my stand because my heart will show fear 4 no man but 4 a broken heart I run with fright scared 2 be blind in a vulnerable night I believe this fear is in every man some will acknowledge it others will fail 2 understand there is no fear in a shallow heart because shallow hearts don\\'t fall apart but feeling hearts that truly care are fragile 2 the flow of air and if I am 2 be true then I must give my fragile heart I may receive great joy or u may return it ripped apart     when I was alone and had nothing I asked 4 a friend 2 help me bear the pain no one came except . . . God  when I needed a breath 2 rise from my sleep no one could help me except . . . God  when all I saw was sadness and I needed answers no one heard me except . . . . God  so when I\\'m asked who I give my unconditional love 2 Look For No other Name except . . . GOD!     let\\'s not talk of money let us forget the world 4 a moment let\\'s just revel in our eternal comradery in my Heart I know there will never be a day that I don\\'t remember the times we shared u were a friend when I was at my lowest and being a friend 2 me was not easy or fashionable regardless of how popular I become u remain my unconditional friend unconditional in its truest sense Did u think I would forget Did u 4 one moment dream that I would ignore u  if so remember this from here 2 forever nothing can come between us     There R no words 2 express how much I truly care So many times I fantasize of feelings we can share My heart has never known the Joy u bring 2 me As if GOD knew what I wanted and made u a reality I\\'d die 2 hold u or 2 kiss u or merely to see your face my stomach quivers my body shivers and my heart increases pace 2 give me $ or lots of gold would not be the same 2 me I prayed and watched the distant stars and finally u came 2 me!  Faithfully Yours, Tupac Amaru Shakur     If there be pain, all u need 2 do is call on me 2 be with u And before u hang up the phone u will no longer be alone Together we can never fall because our love will conquer all  If there be pain, reach out 4 a helping hand and I shall hold u wherever I am Every breath I breathe will be into u 4 without u here my joy is through my life was lived through falling rain so call on me if there be pain  Faithfully yours, Tupac Amaru Shakur 19     pretty smiles deceiving laughs and people who dream with their eyes open lonely children unanswered cries and souls who have given up hoping The other thing that breaks hearts R fairy tales that never come true and selfish people who lie 2 me selfish people just like u     The day I met u I saw strength and I knew from that point on that u were pure woman 2 me possessing a spirit that was strong  I want smiles 2 replace the sorrow that u have encountered in the past and since it was strength that attracted me 2 u it will take strength 2 make it last  My negative side will attempt 2 change u but please fight that with your all it will be your strength that keep us both standing while others around us fall     I don\\'t have everything As a matter of fact I don\\'t have anything, except a dream of a better day And you, to help me find my way Being a man I am sure to make mistakes But to keep you, I would do all it takes and if it meant my love was really true I\\'d gladly die and watch over you I wish you knew how much I cared You\\'d see my love is true. By the life we\\'d share Even if you changed your mind and said our love was thru I\\'d want to die, continuously cry and still I\\'d love you     Introduced with innocence who would have ever guessed That u were the one I had Been so desperately searching 4 u Talk as I do but yet u don\\'t understand when I mumble u c as I do but your vision is blurred by naivete This is the barrier that separates us I cannot cross yet There is 2 much of me that would frighten u so I live in heartache because we cannot fully explore this love and what of your heartache Does it feel as sharp as mine No matter where I go or how long it takes I will never recover from this mutual heartache.     Just when I thought I\\'d seen it all our paths crossed and met and I knew from the First glance that u would be hard 2 4get your eyes attracted me First but you reeked of sultry confidence I couldn\\'t wait 2 touch lips and kiss with my Heart\\'s intentions when we did it was what I expected and 4 that moment we erased the tension of the awkwardness of First Date Jitters and the initials Blind Date First impressions we kissed again and I felt the passion and This was CUPID\\'S Blessing     What of a love unspoken? Is it weaker without a name? Does this love deserve 2 exist without a title because I dare not share its name Does that make me cruel and cold 2 deny the world of my salvation because I chose 2 let it grow People tend 2 choke that which they do not understand Why shouldn\\'t I be weary and withhold this love from MAN What of a love unspoken no one ever knows But this is a love that lasts and in secrecy it grows     U say that u\\'ll love me forever but what about today As the dusks become dawns and the years pass on will u love me the same way If so let us rejoice and bathe in constant pleasure If not spare my heart today and I shall recover before forever And if my doubts and ?\\'s upset u, forgive my fragile heart I just wanted 2 know if you\\'d love me forever Before Today would START!     I haven\\'t yet for reasons of your own But soon I\\'m sure you\\'ll tire from being alone u haven\\'t recovered from the pain of the past So u show me affection behind the wall of glass But when I do finally kiss u u will realize at last my heart was true     u saw innocence at its best I wanted u more than I wanted me I remember my last thought at night was of u and my first thought in the morning was of u It has been a long time since I\\'ve actually sat and adored u but every once in awhile your beautiful smile guides me through a day I hear u R with another and u R expecting I wish u good luck he is lucky 2 be able 2 wake up 2 u each morning c u in heaven!     Every word cuts 2 the heart conversations R ended be4 they start is this what u want? is this what I want? is this what must be?  This is not a game This is a love one should be played The other cherished I feel 2 hearts breaking...  is this what u want? is this what I want? is this what must be?     you ask me 2 communicate what it is I feel within I search 4 words 2 assist but I find none 2 help me begin I guess love is just complicated Love is just complicated.  I thought I knew my heart\\'s desire I thought I quenched my burning fire I thought I wanted \"A\" But \"A\" was 2 mixed up with \"B\" Then \"C\" made me more confused So \"A\" turned off me and \"B\" feels better. \"C\" is upset and lonely and me, I think Love is complicated. Love is just complicated.     I remember when u were LOST and your soul was in the wind It was at this awkward moment that u and I became friends But then your soul was found and u discovered celibacy But with this u forgot about me and our bond was a memory And now I c u felt it the bond we made before I pray 2 God it stands and severs never more     I know my heart has lied before but now it speaks with honesty of an invisible bond of friendship that was formed in secrecy Coming from me this may seem hard but 2 GOD I swear it\\'s truth We R friends for eternity and Forever I will always love u  With All My Heart, & \"Spirit\"  P.S. Just so u don\\'t forget that I am here for u. U R a true friend.     From first glance I know exactly what would Be u and I have perfect hearts destined one day 2 Be The circumstances don\\'t even matter because my heart never lies And if u don\\'t admit 2 this it is u who will be surprised     2 me your name alone is poetry I barely know u and already I can\\'t explain this feeling I feel 4 APRIL  I want 2 c u from the moment u leave my side till the moment u return My nonchalant cold heart finally has eyes only 4 APRIL  So now I risk it all Just 4 the feeling of joy u bring me I accept the ridicule in exchange for the words u share with me All of this & much more I will do 4 APRIL     I hope u heard me when I asked u that night 2 be my wife Not for this year or next But mine for all your life 2 accept me when I sin and understand me when I fail Not 2 mention standing the rain which comes down as hard as hail I am not the best of men My faults could scare the night But my heart is always pure 2 my wife 4 life     My tears they fall with passion Like tears conceived from stars Full of brightness & energy Seen only from afar Tonight these tears are full of pain but also I can feel relief from my heart Because the stigma is revealed unfaithful and unforgiven I cannot bear 2 let this be So I must be pure 2 only her for eternity     Today I wake & feel even lonelier But I c positive potential My heart shook much like the Quake Then the pain was gone The arctic breeze formed the fortress Barricading my fragile Heart from PAIN  It is not that I don\\'t love u and it was because I did love u that I must move on as long as I breathe I will remember \"WE AS 2\"     MEN! u shouldn\\'t listen 2 your selfish heart It doesn\\'t really have a brain Besides keeping u alive Its existence is in vain \"How could I be so mean, and say your heart has no place?\" Because mortal men fall in love again as fast as they changed their face I may be cruel, but think awhile about The hearts that u have broken Match that with the empty vows and broken promises u\\'ve spoken I am not saying females R perfect Because men we know it\\'s not true But why must u be unfaithful If her heart is true 2 u!!!!  -Shakur     The power of a gun can kill and the power of Fire can Burn The power of wind can chill and the power of the mind can learn The power of anger can rage inside until it tears u apart But the Power of a Smile especially yours can heal a frozen Heart     First there was nothing Not even the Faint echo of a song Loneliness was daily 4 me until u came along There was a gleam of STARS in your eyes I thought I\\'d  never feel this way again But u were the one 2 reach into my heart And find in me a Friend I could not ignore the magnetism that I felt when u were near And any problems plaguing my mind would suddenly disappear It was the rebirth of my heart The day u became my friend Because I knew from the moment I held u that I would find love again     We made love within a storm in the midst of passion and chaos somewhere, somehow our true bond of friendship was lost  In the eye of the storm The rain always falls harder Those who prevail this trauma will learn 2 bring their love farther  But now the storm has passed and the seas of our friendship R calm But as long as I live I will remember the Love within the storm     All of my life I dreamed of meeting one with immense beauty, and once I found her I would charm her and she\\'d be mine forever.  I have found her and indeed she is all I wished for and more but she is not charmed nor intrigued. Then I think 2 myself \"What can I offer her?\" The tears warm my eyes and blur my vision. I stick 2 my stance of bravado and give her the same uninterested look she gave me. She was so beautiful But what can I offer her     U R the omega of my heart The foundation 4 my conception of Love When I think of what a black woman should be Its u that I First think of  U will never fully understand How Deeply my Heart Feels 4 u I worry that we\\'ll grow apart And I\\'ll end up losing u  U bring me 2 climax without sex And u do it all with regal grace U r my heart in Human Form A Friend I could never replace     The day u chose 2 leave me it rained constantly outside in truth I swore the rain 2 be The tears in Cupid\\'s eyes  TS     I ran outside 2 feel the rain and I stayed outside awhile When the rain was done along came the sun and this was Cupid\\'s Smile!     With my eyes closed I can c we have a chance 2 discover ecstasy but the clouds of doubt have made u blind but the clouds of doubt have made u blind so u R afraid of the emotions that u may find I know that u\\'ve been hurt before but this is no excuse 4 u 2 ignore the seed that cupid planted, in hopes that we would sow This infant emotion deserves 2 breathe so why won\\'t u let it grow A neglected flower will wither and on its own it will surely die But with honesty, passion, and mutual respect we can Soar Beyond The Sky So please don\\'t follow what u c follow the rhythm within your heart Believe in me though u cannot c what lies within the Dark     In the midst of passion 2 figures stand emerged in ecstasy joined hand and hand words R unnecessary feelings R heart the body takes control deaf 2 words It is at this stage that I think of u in gratitude 4 this joy u have exposed me 2 Each Day is Bright with you as the Dawn with the collapse of each night a strong bond is born In the midst of passion I remember your kiss I reminisce about your touch and suddenly miss the scent u wear and the tone of your voice Only u can be my choice In the midst of passion I c u & me Lost in constant ecstasy!!     There were 2 people with one wish 2 Live a Life filled with LOVE 2 GOD they would pray that 2gether they\\'d stay under the stars above But someone else made a wish at the same time on the same breath And although the wish 4 love was granted So was this evil wish 4 Death Now I make a wish sealed with tears and laughter It is my wish that these 2 loves R reunited in the hereafter     I think of u in my arms And what it would be like 2 Make Love I think of u raising my SEED And what they\\'d be made of I think of how alone I was Before u came 2 be I think of the joy I felt when u said u thought of me I\\'m proud to be the heart u choose 2 make a friend Hours pass by and Cupid cries until we meet again     Held captive 4 your politics They wanted 2 break your soul They ordered the extermination of all minds they couldn\\'t control 4 u the fate was far worse than just a brutal homicide They caged u like an animal and watched u slowly die inside As u Breathe your first air of freedom on the day u become a free man Raise your Regal Brow in Pride 4 now you R in God\\'s Hands The life of many were given so that the day would one day come That the devils in Power at Pretoria would pay for the evil crimes they\\'ve done     This poem is addressed 2 Mrs. Hawkins who lost her son 2 a racist society I\\'m not out 2 offend the positive souls only the racist dogs who lied 2 me An American culture plagued with nights like the night Yusef was killed if it were reversed it would be the work of a savage but this white killer was just strong-willed But Mrs. Hawkins as sure as I\\'m a Panther with the blood of Malcolm in my veins America will never rest if Yusef dies in vain!     Your ways R similar 2 the rays of the sun Warm 2 many but 2 strong 4 some The more u R needed the brighter u shine Watched 4 2 long and your brilliance will blind The eyes of mortal men who threaten u with Doom They regret 2 c u set but it is time 4 the moon  -TS     They could never understand what u set out 2 do instead they chose 2 ridicule u when u got weak They loved the sight of your dimming and flickering starlight How could they understand what was so intricate 2 be loved by so many, so intimate they wanted 2 c your lifeless corpse This way u could not alter the course of ignorance that they have set 2 make my people forget what they have done for much 2 long 2 just forget and carry on I had loved u forever because of who u R And now I mourn our fallen star     It would be like a panther asking a panther hunter 4 some meat, all High school dropouts R not DUMB All unemployed aren\\'t lazy and there R many days I hunger But I would go hungry and homeless Before the American Government gets my soul     Because we all spring from different trees does not mean we are not created equally  Is the true beauty in the tree or in the vast forest in which it breathes the tree must fight 2 breed among the evils of the weeds  I find greatness in the tree that grows against all odds it blossoms in darkness and gives birth 2 promising pods.  I was the tree who grew from weeds and wasn\\'t meant 2 be ashamed I\\'m not in fact I am proud of my thriving family tree     The choice is no stranger 2 poverty your soul or Government Assistance I\\'m 18 in a country with no path 4 a young unaddicted Black youth with a Dream Instead I am giving the Ultimatum     When your hero falls from grace all fairy tales R uncovered myths exposed and pain magnified the greatest pain discovered u taught me 2 be strong but I\\'m confused 2 c u so weak u said never 2 give up and it hurts 2 c u welcome defeat when ure Hero falls so do the stars and so does the perception of tomorrow without my Hero there is only me alone 2 deal with my sorrow. your Heart ceases 2 work and your soul is is not happy at all what R u expected 2 do when ure only Hero falls     Strength is overcome by weakness Joy is overcome by Pain The night is overcome by Brightness and Love - it remains the same     Before u came the triangle never broke we were bonded and melded as one But as the 2 pushed u away The one got weak and embraced u and now u R ripping us Apart  The worst feeling of helplessness The greatest pain has rested in my heart The vision of heaven fades and the nightmare of loneliness has started  My Hero has been defeated by you and now what can I do watch as u Destroy us and our love is finally Through  I know the worst is Here I feel it in my Heart u got into the circle now you\\'re tearing us apart !!!!!!!!!!!!!!

The daddy just ran out the door     Where there is a will there is a way 2 Search and discover a Better Day  Where a positive heart is all u Need 2 Rise Beyond and succeed  Where young mind grow and respect each other Based on their Deeds and not their color  When times R dim say as I say.. \"Where there is a will There is a way!\"     Excuse me but Lady Liberty needs glasses And so does Mrs. Justice by her side Both the broads R blind as bats Stumbling thru the system Justice bumped into Mutulu and Trippin\\' on Geronimo Pratt But stepped right over Oliver And his crooked partner Ronnie Justice stubbed her Big Toe on Mandela And liberty was misquoted by the Indians Slavery was a learning phase Forgotten without a verdict While Justice is on a rampage 4 endangered surviving Black males I mean really if anyone really valued life And cared about the masses They\\'d take \\'em both 2 Pen Optical And get 2 pairs of glasses     Sometimes I wonder about this race Because we must be blind as Hell 2 think we live in equality while Nelson Mandela rots in a jail cell Where the shores of Howard Beach are full of Afrikan corpses And those that do live 2 be 18 Bumrush 2 join the Armed Forces This so called \"Home of the Brave\" why isn\\'t anybody Backing us up!

ANSWER: WHEN THE EARTH FALLS 2 PIECES!!     I pour my heart in2 this poem and look 4 the meaning of Life the rich and powerful always prevail and the less fortunate strive through strife MISTAKES R MADE 2 be 4given we R 2 young 2 stress and suffer The path of purity and positivity has always ridden rougher Your insatiable desire 2 find perfection Has made your faults magnify curiosity can take Blame For the evil that makes u cry It isn\\'t a good feeling when u disobey your Heart The nightmares haunt your Soul and your nerves R ripped apart     I\\'m going in2 this not knowing what I\\'ll find but I\\'ve decided 2 follow my heart and abandon my mind and if there be pain I know that at least I gave my all and it is better 2 have loved and lost than 2 not love at all In the morning I may wake 2 smile or maybe 2 cry but first 2 those of my past I must say goodbye     In the event of my Demise when my heart can beat no more I hope I die for a principle or a belief that I had lived 4 I will die before my time Because I feel the shadow\\'s depth so much I wanted 2 accomplish Before I reached my death I have come 2 grips with the possibility and wiped the last tear from my eyes I loved all who were positive In the event of my Demise!     [Sample] Heyyyy! Heyy-ayyaahhyy  [Intro: 2Pac] Yo, Mo Bee, mayn, drop that shit! You know what time Boo-yaow! I know it\\'s time for you So grab one by the hand, you know what I\\'m sayin\\'?

Don\\'t be phony Cause I hate it when you act like, you don\\'t know me I\\'ve been stressin\\' in the spotlight, I want the fame But the industry\\'s a lot like, a crap game Ain\\'t no time for commitment, I gotta go Can\\'t be with you every minute miss, another show And even though I\\'m known for my one night stand Look here, I wanna be an honest man, but temptations go—  [Interlude: 2Pac] Throw up the finger! And all my homies go Throw them the finger! You know what, baby, it\\'s like—  [Chorus: Easy Mo Bee] I know you\\'ve been searchin\\' for someone To make you happy and get the job done You say you needed a man with money But I can\\'t be there, and will you still care?  [Verse 2: 2Pac] Will I cheat or will I be committed? Heaven knows Gettin\\' weak and I wanna hit it, so here I go In my ride and I\\'m all in, gettin\\' high I can hear the people callin\\', I\\'m passin\\' by Everybody knows I\\'m ballin\\', and to God Gotta keep myself from fallin\\', but it\\'s hard All the cuties know I\\'m under pressure, what do I do?

[Verse 3] Pour out some liquor and I reminisce ‘Cause through the drama I can always depend on my mama And when it seems that I\\'m hopeless You say the words that can get me back in focus When I was sick as a little kid To keep me happy there\\'s no limit to the things you did And all my childhood memories Are full of all the sweet things you did for me And even though I act crazy I gotta thank the Lord that you made me There are no words that can express how I feel You never kept a secret, always stayed real And I appreciate how you raised me And all the extra love that you gave me I wish I could take the pain away If you can make it through the night, there\\'s a brighter day Everything will be alright if you hold on It\\'s a struggle every day, gotta roll on And there\\'s no way I can pay you back, but my plan Is to show you that I understand: you are appreciated  [Chorus: Reggie Green & Sweet Franklin +  2Pac] Lady, don\\'t you know we love ya? (Dear Mama) Sweet lady, place no one above ya (You are appreciated) Sweet lady, don\\'t you know we love ya? (Dear Mama) Sweet lady, lady (Dear Mama) Lady, lady     [Intro] Hey, Suge, what I tell you, nigga? When I come out of jail, what I was gonna do?

[Ambient city noises followed by gunshots and people yelling]  Davey D: Rapper, actor, controversial ghetto child- Tupac Amaru Shakur was born on June 16, 1971 in the Bronx, New York, and he died tragically on September 13, 1996 in Las Vegas, Nevada. Tupac was named after a famous Inca chief. His middle name, \"Amoro,\" meant \"shining serpent.\" His last name, \"Shakur\" meant \"thankful to God.\"  (Thankful to God, thankful to God, thankful to God)     [Interview]  Sway: Ayy yo right now I\\'m chillin\\' with 2Pac. The Bay area\\'s on right here, what\\'s up Pac, how ya doing brother?  2Pac: What\\'s poppin\\'? What\\'s poppin\\'?  Sway: First off, I want to congratulate you on all your success man, \\'cause I kind of watched you evolve, and you know ,and even though, you know, I think most people from the Bay area, even though we couldn\\'t be there by your side, we kind of felt like every episode you went through in your life that we could only see through the media, we was right there, you know. And Brothers got a lotta love for you in the Bay, wanna know when you\\'re coming back, for minute.  2Pac: I\\'m comin\\' back for sure... and I love the Bay. And Everywhere I go, and every episode I\\'ve been through, I always felt like I was sharing it, the good times and the bad with the Bay, \\'cause you know they ones— I felt like whatever I am, the Bay Area had something to do with making me. So if I\\'m bad then they had something to do with making me, if I\\'m good, then they had something to do with making me. Between the East Coast, the Bay Area and LA and Baltimore, ya know what I mean? Made me who I am.. made me stand out. I owe them everything. It\\'s not like saying like I got love for one block. I got love for those communities, those areas because everything about those areas made me who I am, and people from the little--the littlest you know crackheads to the biggest ballers to the teachers, to the principals in school, to the police that pulled me by the arm. Everybody- to the mama\\'s on the block, everybody they helped raise me and I appreciate it. Because without a family, they helped me put my family back together, just by all my fans making me who I am. Now I\\'ve got a family again. When I started rapping, I was talking about broken homes and shit. Now everybody alright again, just because of my fans being behind me, you know what I mean? They make it more than just a fan-artist thing, they making it more like \"That\\'s our homeboy, we supporting him,\" and I appreciated that going to jail and making me number one, they made me number one, you know what I mean? and I appreciated that, and I appreciate them sticking up for me when everybody kicking me when I\\'m down and everything, that\\'s love and I never trade that so for the Bay and Philly and all those areas man, all those ghettos and towns... I \\'love y\\'all... don\\'t let this East Coast-West Coast thing get to you. I love you with all my hear with everything. I do this for y\\'all. Just know that if it was you, you\\'d do the same thing in my position.  (That\\'s KC)  ( What\\'s poppin\\' man? Come back here man. Oh okay... okay.) That\\'s KC, y\\'all. Doing the video for \"How Do You want it\"  Sway: Yeah, we kickin\\' it in the trailer with these fools right now, and it\\'s setting off the hook, it\\'s setting off the hook. On a serious note though, this is what I wanted to ask you man, \\'cause it seems like every time you come up, like on with each album, something will set you back. Like the incident that happened in Berkeley back in the day with the police incident the trials you went through with the lady back east, and then the situation you\\'re in now, you know. You getting caught up in the system. Every time you come up, it seems like there\\'s something bring you back down. When you\\'re caught up like that, what is it that goes through your mind, when you know you got millions of fans wondering about you?  2Pac: It hurts me in one way because they be lookin\\' at me saying \"Damn you got everything why are you doing this?\" And in my heart, I\\'ll be like \"Damn man y\\'all know I don\\'t wanna go to jail, I\\'m just tryna live.\" On the other hand, it\\'s like I can\\'t really take it personal because I\\'m a reflection of the community, and all young Black males are going through that, young Black females, young white males... A lot of minorities periods is going through that going through.. tryna come up and then get pulled back five steps... then you move make 8 steps then they pull you back 18 steps To me it\\'s not personal because they\\'re all going through it. The only thing that makes it different and original with me is that people get to watch it from beginning to end like a soap opera. You get to watch mines and with everyone else, they get to hide and go to their homes and get over it. With me you see me doing it, dealing with my greatest pains. You see me get over things. and go through things, handle my life, you seen it, everybody saw it. So that\\'s what makes it different  Sway: Yeah, it\\'s like your whole life is like an open book and after you got the incident getting shot in that whole nine. I mean what went through your head—I mean I read a lot of stuff and I hear a lot of stuff on TV, but I\\'ve been inclined not to believe everything you read in the paper, you know? and the things you see in the TV— I mean What went through your head when you got shot in New York and that whole complication that you had with the people you had it with?  2Pac: I can\\'t front. It slowed me down. It went through my mind was \"like damn I\\'m shot.\" I couldn\\'t believe I could ever get touched. So now that\\'s why I\\'m more careful, and ever more— Some people may say \"disrespectful\" but I\\'m more cautious because I have been shot five t— So I know what it feels like. It\\'s like I\\'m cautious now, I\\'m not trying to be in that predicament. I know we all have choices to make and my choices have already been made even if I wanna change it. What I learned in jail is that I can\\'t be changed. I can\\'t you know live a different lifestyle... this is it. This is the life that they gave me and this is the life that I made. You know how they say \"you made your bed now lay in it?\" I tried to move... I can\\'t move to no other bed. This is it. Not for the court, not for the parole board, not for nobody. This is what they gave me. All I\\'m trying to do is survive and make good out of the dirt nasty, unbelievable lifestyle that they gave me. I\\'m just trying to make something good out of that. It\\'s like if you try and plant something in the concrete..if it grow and the rose pedals got all kind of scratches and marks, you\\'re not gon\\' say \"Damn look at all the scratches on the rose that grew from the concrete.\" Your gonna say... Damn! A rose grew from the concrete? Same thing for me I grew out all of this, instead of saying \"Damn he did this, he did this. Just be like \"Damn! \"He grew out of that?\" He came out of that?.. That\\'s what they should see.  Sway: That\\'s exactly what I see because you know.. Brother you must be truly blessed to go through all these trials and tribulations you\\'ve been through and you\\'re still maintaining. Even now they\\'re still comin\\'. You got these demons and obstacles—[What\\'s up with that] they just keep coming down harder and harder. I mean every time you turn around, you got somebody knockin\\' on your door trying to take something from you.  2Pac: They come harder and harder, and that\\'s what kills me. It\\'s like everytime I think this is it and I go all out to beat that and I win or I lose.. Then I come into the next one, it just worse, it\\'s even worse. It\\'s like the twilight zone that is like some evil, unstoppable shit that is just won\\'t let me go. It\\'s got its hands on me and just wanna see me fail. And in my mind sometimes when I get— When I\\'m drunk or I\\'m just laying down... I be thinking like \"Damn is this true?.. Well I fail? Am I supposed to fail? I mean should I just stop trying and give up?\" But then I be like \"Nah, hold on! That\\'s exactly what they\\'re waiting for me to do\\'\", instead of just say \"This is too much I can\\'t take it\" and give up. So now it\\'s a fun little game that I cry at sometime, I laugh at sometime, I smile, have good time and bad times. But it\\'s a game. It\\'s just game of life. Do I win or do I lose? I know one day they\\'re gon\\' shut the game down but I have to have as much fun and get around the board as many times as I can before it\\'s my turn to leave. And that\\'s it  Sway: That\\'s for real. We chillin\\' Tupac right now. We gonna come back with some more Tupac. We just loungin\\' in his trailer.     Davey D: His mother, Afeni Shakur, was a member of the Black Panther Party.  She was pregnant with Tupac while in jail and on trial as one of the Infamous New York 21. This was a time where all the members of the party were accused of conspiracy to bomb public places. Afeni Shakur was eventually acquitted of all charges. Tupac\\'s aunt Assata Shakur was also a member of the Black Panther Party. She was accused of killing a New Jersey state trooper. She eventually fled the country in exile. Today she still lives in Cuba. Tupac described his mom as a strong-willed woman who handled her business. His real father was unknown. As a youth, he identified with a pimp and petty hustler named \"Legs\" who later died from a crack-induced heart attack. Tupac was described as an energetic child who always liked to imagine himself in the lead role. His mom saw fit to enroll him at age 12 in the 127 Street Ensemble, which was a theatre group in Harlem, New York. Tupac’s first acting role was the character, Travis, in the play Raisin in the Sun. Tupac did not involve himself with rap until he and his family moved to Baltimore. As a young teenager, he took on the name \"MC New York.\" While living in Baltimore, Tupac continued his acting by auditioning and later being accepted in Baltimore\\'s Prestigious School for the Arts. At age 17, Tupac moved with his mom to Marin City in the San Francisco Bay area. It was in Marin City that Tupac lived about street life. In an attempt to be accepted and fit in with his peers, Tupac became a petty hustler who sold drugs. It was in Marin City that Tupac rediscovered rap. He ingratiated himself in the Bay Area\\'s emerging rap scene by joining a group called Strictly Dope. This group featured fellow Bay Area rap star Ray Luv. While a member of Strictly Dope, Tupac decided to branch out and he eventually became friends with Digital Underground’s lead rapper, Shock G. Tupac auditioned for the group and he eventually became part of the group first as a roadie and later as a dancer. He went on to be a hype man for the group Digital Underground. As a member of Digital Underground, Tupac became known as \"the rebel of the underground.\" Much of this had to do with his excitable and unpredictable personality. Tupac\\'s tendency to stir up things had lead to many of his successes, as well as many of his troubles.  (Troubles, troubles, troubles, troubles...)     [Interview]  Sway: Ayy we back chillin\\' with Tupac. This man is multimedia. Not only is he a recording artist, but he\\'s also an actor. But before we get into the acting, I want to say... How did you first get down with Suge Knight in Death Row?  2Pac: I used to always see Suge. When they did the soundtrack for Murder Was The Case and I was going through all those legal problems. He was like \"Yo give me a song dog.\" I gave him a song and I got the most I ever got for a song. It was damn near an album budget. I got something like 200 thousand dollars for one song and they didn\\'t even use it. But I still got paid for everything I did for the soundtrack. I remember when he did it. He did it not because he was jocking me, but because he knew I was having crazy legal problems and I was a man. He had asked me to come to Death Row and I told him I wasn\\'t ready. Instead of taking it personal he did that for me and I appreciated that. So when I was in jail just sittin\\' there, I was gonna quit rappin\\' but then Puffy and Biggie came out in Vibe Magazine and lied and twisted the facts. All I wanted to do was end everything and walk away from the shit. I wanted to get out the game. I\\'m trying to get out the game and they wanna dirty up my memory. They wanna dirty up everything I worked for. So instead of quitting, it made me wanna come back and be more relentless to destroy who used to be my comrades and homeboys. These guys were my closest click. I worked hard all my life as far as this music business to bring about east coast west coast love and make everybody feel comfortable. I dreamed of the day when I could go to New York and feel comfortable and they could come out here and be comfortable. So when people ask me about this east coast/west coast thing it\\'s not silly at all. But you can\\'t disrespect the love. You can\\'t disrespect the peace treaty. That\\'s just like when the Indians made deals with the white dudes and they would just come and rape their women and shoot\\' em up and leave. Of course the Indians aren\\'t gonna love white people no more. They\\'re gonna want to kick up some dust until people think about it and renegotiate the terms of the treaty and that\\'s where this East Coast/West Coast stuff is at right now. We gotta have this beef and these words and this dialogue until we can re negotiate the terms of the treaty. I love the East Coast. I from the east coast, but they have to understand you just can\\'t be saying shit about us and think we\\'re not gonna take it personally. You just can\\'t be calling us fakers and pretenders and non-creative and say we can\\'t freestyle, and we just sit back and say \"Nah it\\'s cool \\'cause we love them because they started hip hop.\" Hell no, we\\'re gonna take it personal, just like a kid would when his bigger brother who ain\\'t doing his shit steps to him. That\\'s like a little brother making lots of cash and the bigger brother comin\\' along and sayin\\' \"You owe it all to me.\" That\\'s wrong. Don\\'t be mad because the little nigga is comin\\' up. You know what I mean?  Sway: Now, do you think the East Coast/West Coast rivalry is like both coasts? Because a lot of people think it\\'s more Bad Boy/Death Row.  2Pac: It\\'s not both coasts. What it is... is the people on the East coast are real proud and real cultural and real strong like we are on the west coast. What happen was Biggie came at a time just like Hitler did with the Jews. Biggie came at a time when they were open to somebody saying \"We\\'re the master race and these guys are nothing. They\\'re pretenders and this is why we\\'re not makin\\' it in the business. It\\'s because of these guys. This is why we\\'re not doing nothing.\" So the east coast really not hatin\\' us or knowing anything about us... have just been listening to their supposed to be leader. They were listening to the person who\\'s supposed to be representing\\' for them. They didn\\'t know that what they were doing was ending our culture. We held it down for you all. That\\'s how I felt. I was in tears.. When LL was out there dancin\\' with women in silver suits which I\\'m not mad at because I might do that one day. But when the East coast was trying to be creative and test other boundaries we were holdin\\' it down with this hardcore shit. It might not have been what you wanted but it kept rap alive for years. It kept money comin\\' in. It let them notice us. So how could you look at us and say \"You\\'re not good enough?\" We\\'re from a broken home. Y\\'all didn\\'t teach us this. We ain\\'t got no subways and graffiti. In spite of the gangs and all of that we still came up with this culture. I feel like we never got what we deserved. I took it personal because I\\'m from the East coast and I know about that culture but I know about this culture because I was here when it was being put down. So now I\\'m doing what the East coast would\\'ve did if the west coast did this to them. I\\'m riding for my side. You\\'re wrong. It\\'s not right. Recognize us. The only way the east coast is gonna recognize us if for us to do it on record, by money, by sales and by representing. Just like KRS-One. When PM Dawn got on stage and he had been talking shit about him..what did KRS-One do? So why are people telling me I\\'m wrong for doing what I\\'m doing. They love KRS-One.. He is hip hop..am I correct? I\\'m mad at Biggie and I\\'m rushin\\' the nigga. What\\'s the problem? As soon as the east coast separate themselves from Biggie we will do shows in the east. Everything is beautiful. But so far the east coast has been with him. Everything I read..every letter I read. every interview I read. Niggas keep saying \"Fuck 2Pac\" Biggie Biggie this and Biggie Biggie that like he\\'s representin\\' everyone from the east coast. That\\'s why I attack the way I do. I\\'m a general and I\\'m a smart general and I\\'m not gonna attack at no blind soldier. I\\'m gonna attack those who attack me. The only reason why people was mad was because I came out of jail and made this a reality. When I got out of jail the east coast west coast shit was really started. California Love, when I was singin\\' put it down. and now niggas is mad because money is fucked up, attitudes have changed. It\\'s not as safe as it used to be. Nigguhs gotta think about their business and that\\'s what I wanted to happen. Now let\\'s go to the table. Let\\'s talk. Let\\'s make peace. Let\\'s work it out. Let\\'s give the community the money.  Sway: So you\\'re saying with a conversation with guys like Puffy, Biggie, and that whole East Coast-  2Pac: I wouldn\\'t sit down and have a conversation with Puffy and Biggie because that\\'s like Scarface sitting down with the dude he overthrew. They are not on my level. But I can sit down with the OG\\'s and from there which we are doing. People need to know we\\'re not beefing with the East coast. We\\'re about to start Death Row East with Eric B and all the OG niggas out there. We got Big Daddy Kane, Christopher Williams... we\\'re trying to get Bobby Brown. We\\'re trying to get the East coast Death Row to be like the West Coast Death Row and make it major. We\\'re not doing that until we get this business settled. Even while we\\'re doing this we\\'re trying to get the Wu-Tang niggas. I love them niggas. I feel as though they represent the east coast the way we represent the west coast and I love them. If everybody\\'s raps is what they really think then everybody should understand what I\\'m doing. It\\'s gangsta shit, number one. It\\'s warrior shit, number two, and it\\'s all by the rules of the game. I\\'m calling for dialogue. I\\'m gathering attention for dialogue which is what you do in a struggle for power.  Sway: That\\'s real, that\\'s real. We still chillin\\' with Tupac. It\\'s intense. I love this brother. I like this. My man keepin\\' it real. We\\'re gonna come back with more Tupac...     Davey D: In 1991, Tupac got his first real taste of trouble when he was stopped for jay walking in downtown Oakland. According to Pac, the police officers did not take a liking to his name, for they said some unfavorable things. Pac in return responded and the result was him being arrested and brutalized. This incident resulted  in him filing a 10 million dollar lawsuit against the City of Oakland. It wasn\\'t long afterwards that Tupac released the first of his six albums. The first was entitled 2Pocalypse Now and it highlighted Tupac’s passionate, political, and thug life side. Songs like \"Trap\" while politically on point, stirred up much of the controversy when it depicted an Oakland police officer being shot at the end of the video. This particular song caught the attention of Dan Quayle, who expressed his outrage. Other songs like \"Brenda Got a Bay\" brought attention to the emotional and heartfelt side of the rising star. Tupac gained national fame when he played the role of Roland Bishop, a violent, insecure, short-tempered, psychotic individual, and the blockbuster movie Juice. Initially, director Ernest Dickerson had invited Digitial Underground\\'s Money B to audition for the movie. Tupac went along for the ride. Once there, he read the part cold turkey and was hired to play his role, which left many wondering if Tupac was acting or just being himself. As Tupac\\'s popularity began to soar, so did his troubles. In the Summer of ’92 while attending Marine City\\'s 50th Anniversary, Tupac and his entourage had a confrontation with some old acquaintances. During the ensuing fight, a gun was drawn, shots were fired, and a little six-year-old laid dead as an innocent bystander. Tupac\\'s brother Mercedes, who at the time rapped for the group Tony! Toni! Toné! and later for Thug Life, was arrested and charged. Eventually he was let go for lack of evidence. Tupac later found himself embroiled in more controversy when a Texas cop was shot and killed. The widow of the slain officer filed the multi-million dollar civil suit against Tupac, claiming that it was his music and lyrics that influenced the young perpetrator to kill. If that wasn\\'t enough, also in that year, Tupac while visiting the set of Fox TV\\'s In Living Color had an altercation with the limo driver. The result was him being arrested and charged with assault. Eventually the charges would drop. Seemingly wherever Tupac went, trouble followed. First Tupac found himself being charged with assault after he and a group of friends beat up the film directors known as the Hughes Brothers. This incident stemmed from him being fired from the movie Menace II Society.  (-Ciety, -ciety, -ciety, -ciety)     [Interview]  2Pac: People think I just got out of jail and was like, just because I got shit in the East Coast was like \"fuck the East Coast,\" ya know? Half the rappers from the East Coast was there when I got shot. Nobody knew a thing. That\\'s just like you coming to the hood, the police ask \"what happened?\" and everybody\\'s like \"I don\\'t know.\" You know they lying. And all I was doing was like \"give me my proper etiquette.\" If Biggie was out here on the West Coast, he was in the studio with me, we homeboys, and he got shot. No, I wouldn\\'t tell him who did it, but even then, I wouldn\\'t go ride on niggas, but you\\'d wanna know who did it. Then I\\'d be like \"look man, these niggas from Rocksteady. This is where they wanna talk to you and when. That\\'s how I\\'d do it. Just like when the niggas from the \\'60s wanted to get a stretch. I went in there and personally talked to \\'em. I do it by the rules of etiquette. So I got shot, I\\'m like yo, what happened? Come see me and Champ. Biggie all in the answerin\\' machine like \"Pac, whoo, whoo, whoo,\" but I don\\'t see you. My homeboy stretch is going to Biggie\\'s concerts. Niggas is like abandoning me. But then on the air and like on TV they like \"Yeah Pac... keep the struggle on,\" like yo, I\\'m starting into like Slick Rick. Niggas just gonna act like I\\'ma just be in jail and they gonna give me shout outs. They tryna take my position. And if you watch, that\\'s what Biggie did. Listen to his- I- I  was there nigga, I trained the nigga. He used to be under me like my lieutenant. I used to come to New York, I used to do shows and let the nigga come on before I did \"Keep Ya Head Up.\" Because nobody knew the nigga in New York. And I used to tell the nigga \"yo, if you wanna make yo money, you gotta rap for the bitches, do not rap for the niggas.\" I told the nigga \"don\\'t rap for the niggas. Rap for the bitches.\" The bitches will buy your records and the niggas want what the bitches want. So all of a sudden, he changed from-- listen to \"Party and Bullshit.\" Listen to his style. He changed from that to \"Big Papa,\" because of me. I came out with my album Me Against the World, the second one. The first one, I changed everything \\'cause Ready to Die came out and it sounded like my album. All my album was about, ya know,  dealing with death. Then he came out with Ready to Die and I had to switch it. That\\'s why it was less East Coast rap, East Coast beats, because Biggie had just took my shit.  Sway: You could listen to it and that was a success \\'cause he took like West Coast sound and...  2Pac: I told him that. I told him that. I trained him. It was supposed to be Thug Life. All while he was coming up, I used to let him come onstage with me, he was screaming \"Thug Life.\" Niggas puppy cheating me, whoo, whoo. All of a sudden, blew up and he wasn\\'t saying \"Thug Life.\" So I started getting mad, and I was seeing niggas playing, he was hugging me. \"Pac, yo thank you, you was the only nigga that whoo, whoo, whoo.\" And he told me about a week before I got shot, he knew the nigga that shot me. \"Pac, don\\'t hang around this nigga, I\\'ll be walking in with this nigga\" that ended up shooting me. BecauseI knew the nigga too because he was my co-defendant. I was like what you mean? Like I\\'ll talk to you about it later and we didn\\'t talk. Next time I saw him was at the studio where I got shot. So I knew he knew what happened. I was like \"Biggie, what happened?\" He kept sending me messages like a bitch, you know, like I\\'ma come see. No nigga, what happened? While I\\'m in jail, strangers is telling me, \"Yo, you don\\'t know? Biggie\\'s homeboy shot you.\" \\'Cause they bragging. They telling they niggas in jail. \"Yo, we just got Pac. Whoo, whoo whoo.\" And my cousin was in jail in New York \\'cause I got family out there. He sittin\\' right there when the niggas gettin\\' in the car like \"Yo, my homeboys just shot that nigga Tupac.\" So that\\'s how I knew who shot me, what happened, and everything. They mad because I know what happened. That\\'s why they all-  You know, it\\'s Biggie with them in there riding. That\\'s why I know what I\\'m doing. I\\'m destroying him. I fucked his wife. I\\'m fucking him in the game. I\\'m destroying him. He lives by the rules of the game. He lives off of my feet endings. I\\'m showing them how they totally disregard the rules of the game, and he\\'s everything put a mafia nigga.  Sway: You\\'re reinventing him  2Pac: Right. If anyone\\'s a mafia nigga, me. I fucked your bitch, I took five shots. I went your crew. I mean, I just what!? I went to New York. They don\\'t do shows out here. I did Saturday Night Live. Y\\'all forgot!? Live in New York, where everydoby knew I was gonna be there on stage, no problems. Went to the clubs, everything. In the middle of my West Side ride, you know what I mean? I\\'m real about it. I don\\'t hate New York. But if y\\'all don\\'t understand it, fuck it, you\\'re getting rolled over too. Because I year y\\'all. I was in jail and I heard what you was saying on the radio. You know how we got the Wake Up Show? They got their own shows. They got their little shows with Red Alert and this nigga and that nigga and what\\'s his name, um... Flex.  I swear to God dog, they used to the diss the West Coast. They had these commercials where they was like \"hey dog. What\\'s up dog?\" I used to be in New York, in jail, on my radio like \"oh shit.\" You know how you would feel if you heard your homeboy and he just clowns you? And I was like \"oh man.\" And all my homeboys like \"yo, Puffy just did a show out here.\" And I thought, I was like \"we gave them love, we gave them this, we gave them that.\" He was talking all this unity shit and when they go home. Q-Tip, they made all these underground tapes dissing us.  Sway: Q-Tip?  2Pac: Yes! Q-tip! So then when niggas ride back, then they wanna talk about the culture, be hip hop-ish again. But that\\'s not fair! How you gonna be both and that\\'s what they all do. They all play bad asses... They just diss me on the air. They\\'re not personally dissing the West Coast. They like \"The East Side is the best side.\" I seen them. All them niggas was talkin\\' about they respect me and love me. See, I hate that! Because I be dead serious! So now Chino XL is talkin\\' \\'bout me. He got a rhyme. You know how you always got these little metaphors. He said \"you\\'ll get fucked like 2Pac did in jail.\" Now I\\'m tellin\\' y\\'all, beat this nigga\\'s ass. And everybody\\'s gonna be talkin\\' about how wrong I am and how I haven\\'t changed, but what am I supposed to do when a nigga disrepecting my manhood like that? See what I mean? It\\'s like I can\\'t get out the game. Just like Scarface and that kidf rom Carlito\\'s Way, I wanna be legit. I\\'ve got restaurants coming up with Alanis Morissette. Me, Snoop, Suge, and Alanis Morissette are gonna open up a restaurant.  Sway: Alanis is nice.  2Pac: I\\'m doing a soundtrack. My first soundtrack. I\\'m doing Music Supervisor for this movie I\\'m doing now. I\\'ve got Alanis on there, Michelle... whatever her name is. All these Alternative stars. All this shit coming up. But what\\'s gonna reign supreme in \\'96 and \\'97 is the writing I\\'m doing. And it\\'s not even like I feel like I\\'m doing it for hip hop. All I\\'m tryna do is get the impostors out. I remember Biggie sleeping on my couch. I remember begging bitches to fuck. You feel me? So Big Papa don\\'t mean nothing to me. He know it. That\\'s why he can\\'t fight me. That\\'s why he can\\'t battle me. You know what I mean? I can make songs exactly about him and he can\\'t talk about me because he knows. I\\'m the one that used to buy him champagne. All that shitty talking? That was me buying him that. He talking about my lifestyle on his album, because when he was doing his album he was broke. Nigga! I was having money. The shit he talkin\\' \\'bout was my life! Thug life, that\\'s what he talking about. All that Junior MAFIA, them niggas was all young motherfuckers that used to hang around, that I used to give money to, to get on a train to go home at night. Lil\\' Caesar and all of them. So now they rapping against me. You can imagine how I fucking feel. When I got arrested in New York, I got arrested for Biggie. Them guns in my room was Biggie\\'s because them cowards left the room when they heard the police was downstairs and everybody left their guns in my room. So i got four guns in my room. Serial number scratched out and I did not, since I took that case. So you can imagine how I feel when I\\'m in jail for that case. And he out there living the mafia lifestyle, giving me no money, giving me no respect, giving me no tribute, rolling with my road dog who was there when I got shot. I mean come on man, I\\'m not paranoid. I\\'m not paranoid. Y\\'all niggas know what time it is. What it is is that the East Coast drug dealers got them niggas under extortion. I came in and fucked up everything \\'cause I dissed them niggas in the Daily News, when the wrong nigga tried to rob me, which is all he wanted to do. I knew what they told me. They were sending me messages through my closest roll dogs saying \"why did you fight them? They were just coming to take your shit.\" But I won\\'t let nobody take my shit. And I was strapped that day. I had two double GLOCKs on me. And when I pulled for my shit, that\\'s when I got shot. And the reaosn I knew my home boy set me up was because my homeboys knew I was strapped. The dudes came straight for me. My homeboys be hiding, because they knew I was strapped. All they had to do was grab the nigga, and I could\\'ve bust. But they got guns so these niggas be coming for me, and these niggas just sitting there. And they said \"get\" and them niggas dropped to the floor. I knew it was a setup. Nobody come downstairs \\'til after the shots.  Sway: And then now after you shot and you went up, did they look at you like you were a ghost?  2Pac: No, when I walked up standing, I seen it in their eyes. I could never describe this look \\'til you get shot and you see yourself. Niggas looking at me like this... I walked out the elevator. I didn\\'t know I was shot in my head or nothing. I felt like I was acting in a movie. What they really trying to say is this nigga is wrong. I got shot five times, came upstairs, did not know I had got shot five times. I thought I only got shot once.  Sway: God, dude, it sound like you got a lot on your chest.  2Pac: That\\'s why I\\'m giving it to you straight raw because you gotta go back and tell \\'em the shit that we ain\\'t recorded. I\\'m givin\\' you that, ya know, not to give \\'em any specifics, but you know that when someone call you and go \"yo, why the dude...,\" you know they don\\'t trust me, you talk to me, ya know \"blam, blam, blam,\" yeah, ya\\'ll know. You know what I mean? Just like they niggas on their radio stations know. Because what I was mad at is that we didn\\'t have a radio station like that. Me and Snoop got an OK from 92.3 to start Westside Radio. But I don\\'t want to do it unless it\\'s right. What I really just wanted... I was proving a point again. I want our radio stations to be true to us, and we\\'ll be true to y\\'all. Tell us, nigga, if you want that type of love, you better give us some commercials every week. We want new shit like they do in the East Coast.  (East Coast, East Coast, East Coast, East Coast, East Coast, East Coast, East Coast...)     Davey D: Later that year in October of \\'93, Tupac was arrested and accused of shooting two off-duty police officers in Atlanta. Just as that drama was beginning to be sorted out, he was arrested in New York the following month and accused of sexually assaulting a female fan in his hotel room. In the backdrop of that controversy, Tupac managed to release another album entitled Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z., which featured the smash hits \"I Get Around\" and it\\'s emotional tribute to women, \"Keep Your Head Up.\" During this time, Tupac was featured in two more movies. The first was Poetic Justice with Janet Jackson. Here he stirred things up again on the set by refusing to honor Miss Jackson\\'s request to take an AIDS test. The other movie that featured Tupac came out in the Spring of \\'94 with a basketball movie entitled Above The Rim. Just like he did in the movie Juice, here Tupac adorned the role of a gangster.

Makaveli in his own words What!, Outlaw in his own words What! What!) Outlaw     [Interview]  Sway: Yo we back, we back right here with Tupac, you know, just chopping up, chopping up a little bit. We can\\'t let you hear everything, you know. Yeah, yeah, yeah. My man is definitely putting it down. One more thing about Death Row. What’s going on with Dre and how does that affect Death Row as a whole?  2Pac: Dre is doing his own thing. It doesn\\'t effect us. My take on what happened was that Snoop went on trial for murder for his life. Somebody said Dre was in the car. The jury believed that we needed Dre to be able to say he wasn\\'t there..once they would’ve saw that he wasn\\'t there that would\\'ve saved Snoop\\'s whole case. They would\\'ve saw that the witness was lying. Dre never showed up. He said he was too busy. That\\'s how they told me..When they told me that I was like no matter how dope he is and Dre was one of my heroes in the music industry. If he\\'s not down for his homeboys. I don\\'t wanna be a part of him or around him. Plus I feel that what was done in the dark will come to light. There are secrets that everybody’s gonna find out about and you’ll know what I did it. I swear to god y\\'all we are living by the rules of the game.  Sway: Now that’s real. Let\\'s talk about other things, like you told us you got a soundtrack you\\'re working on. You got a new movie right? Why don\\'t you talk on it.  2Pac: We got a movie called Gridlock coming out which is a mainstream movie. It’s me coming back into the theaters with Tim Ross from Pulp Fiction. I don\\'t know who it is, but there\\'s a big name female in the movie. I\\'m the music supervisor for the sound track. It\\'s my first chance ever doing something like this... We got Alanis Morissette and all these other big name alternative groups . It\\'s supposedly people I would never get with. I got them all on the soundtrack just to show what kind of range I got. I\\'ll be putting that type of sound track out and then I\\'ll be putting out a rap sound track. I\\'m gonna do it like a 2Pac album with me doing a whole bunch of solo songs and Snoop on there doing some songs. This is just to show I have a business mind as well as a creative mind. I can make my way in this business besides rapping.  Sway: That\\'s for real too. Now when you work with Janet, you know, I was wondering if maybe you could hook me up with her number.  2Pac: Dawg, on everything that I love. If anybody finds Janet, tell her I\\'m looking for her. That\\'s why I said that shit in my song \"My Minds Made Up,\" but give me Janet. I feel like she got shit twisted and people gone made her my enemy. She ain\\'t my enemy. I ain\\'t mad at her. I want her to know that. It ain\\'t even like that. She met me at a time in my life when I was real immature. I was comin\\' up and going through a lot. Now she probably sees me in a whole different light. Maybe not and maybe she will. I want that opportunity. When I see Janet, I\\'m gonna try to make right where we made wrong.  Sway: I\\'ll be right there with you bruh. Ayy, no. I\\'ma ask you another question. Five years from now, what do you see yourself- five or 10 years from now, what do you see yourself doing?  2Pac: I see myself having a job on Death Row, being the A&R person and an artist that drop an album like Paul McCartney every five years. Not that I\\'m like Paul McCartney but there\\'s no rapper who ever did it so that\\'s why I use him as an example. But I wanna do it at leisure. My music will mean something and I\\'ll drop deeper shit. I\\'ll have my own production company which I\\'m close to right now. I\\'m doing my own movies. I have my own restaurant, which I got right now with Alanis or Suge or Snoop. I just wanna expand. I\\'m starting to put out some calendars for charity. I\\'m gonna start a little youth league in California so we can start playing some east coast teams..some southern teams. I wanna have like a Pop Warner League except the rappers fund it and they\\'re the head coaches. Have a league where you can get a big trophy with diamonds in it for a nigga to stay drug free and stay in school. That\\'s the only way you can be on the team. We\\'ll have fun and eat pizza and have the finest girls there and throw concerts at the end of the year. That\\'s what I mean by giving back. By using what I got to give back to give back.  Sway: And in closing, you know you got a lot of people, fans that\\'s listening to you right now that don\\'t really get a chance to talk to Tupac up and close and personal like we kicked it today. But if there\\'s anything you want people to know about Tupac, what is it you like to say?  2Pac: Number one, when I dis y\\'all meaning like when you come up to me and I\\'m not giving you the type of reaction that you think I should give you, it\\'s not because I\\'m ungrateful. It\\'s because I\\'m nervous. I\\'m paranoid, I just got out of jail. I\\'ve been shot, cheated lied and framed and I just don\\'t know how to deal with so many people giving me that much affection. I never had that in my life. So if I do that, don\\'t take it personal. Try to understand it and see it for what it is.  Now I understand what it\\'s truly like to be a fine female who goes to a club and all the guys just rush you before you\\'re ready to be rushed. Everyone is touching you before you\\'re ready to get touched. So now I have a better understanding of what it\\'s like to be a woman. I have a better understanding of fans not making you do things. I\\'m gonna do it because I love y\\'all. I do appreciate what you did. But if you make me do it, then I don\\'t wanna do it. I don\\'t care how many albums you brought. My fans to me are people who follow me who are down for me..who understand me and no matter what people say, they know me, because they\\'ve followed me through my career.  A lot of people just bought my album. I buy albums all the time. I just buy them to listen to. If you brought my album, you brought it for the music. You didn\\'t buy it so when you see me, I just break down and start eating you out. I don\\'t like that. Don\\'t start extorting me for an autograph. I\\'m real. I give autographs when I want to. I wanna be in this game for a long time. I don\\'t ever wanna hate the fans That\\'s what these other niggas do. They might give you autographs all the time, but they hate you. They never even look at you like people. I do look at you like people. That\\'s why I feel like I can look you in your eye and say \\'Yo I don\\'t feel like doing that right now. I don\\'t feel like signing no autographs. and you should understand. I look at you like a human being. Let\\'s kick it. Let\\'s not take pictures. Let\\'s kick it. Do that. I want some females to do that. Every female wanna come up to me and show me how much they\\'re not attracted tome. Do the opposite cause these ghetto girls, these minority women, they\\'re the only women I can get cause every one else is scared of me. Their parents tell them not to mess with me. Y\\'all can\\'t fade me. Y\\'all can\\'t turn on me Don\\'t change on me. Stay down for me \\'cause I stay down for you and don\\'t extort me unless you intend to do it forever.  Sway: There it is. Tupac Shakur, kickin\\' it on set. Right here.  (Right here, right here, right here, right here...)     [Interview]  Sway: Hey Pac, why don\\'t you talk about the project you are doing with Jodeci right now.  2Pac: \"How Do you Want It.\" My next single is gonna be \"How Do You Want It,\" \"Amerikka’s Most Wanted,\" \"Hit \\'Em Up\" and \"California Love,\" the version people couldn\\'t buy. \"Hit ’Em Up\" is a song which is a classic hip hop record, meaning it\\'s a straight battle record to all the Bad Boy staff. It\\'s to Puffy, to Biggie to Lil Kim, to all of them.  My little homies is attacking them. That\\'s why I\\'m not even addressing the Mobb Deep issue. They\\'re not even on my level. I find it disrespectful that they would even think they can attack me or the West Coast. So I don\\'t even address those busta ass fakes. Please print that. It is on and poppin\\'. If you don’t see me rushin’ them that means it\\'s cause they bowed down. Those Mobb Deep fools they don’t want it. Chino XL, Mobb Deep , Bad Boy, Biggie , Lil Ceasar, Junior Mafia, all of them is on our hit list and I\\'m getting with them with my new click called The Outlaws. They\\'re some Jersey dudes who are keeping that east coast flava poppin\\'. It’s some west coast dudes, southern dudes... It\\'s the epitome of what I represent. You know how I mean?  (You know how I mean? You know how I mean? You know how I mean? You know how I mean?)     [Interview]  2Pac: I got Big Syke from Thug Life, the solo project. We got \"How Do You Want It\" with Ron Hightower doing the directing with me and we got all porno stars. We got all people from the Bay. I got Nina Hartley from the Bay and all the big time people. We just did the video for \"Amerikka\\'s Most Wanted\" which is the classic diss video. We got \\'Piggy\\' and \\'Buffy\\'. And \"How Do You want It\" is just the dirtiest nastiest video I\\'ve ever done. I got a playboy version and a regular version. We got nudity. It\\'s the most amazing video you\\'ll ever see. We\\'re doing videos fro \"All Eyes On Me,\" \"I Ain\\'t Mad At Ya,\" \"All About You.\" The record company got all the money in the world so we\\'re just gonna put it out. When things get real slow, we\\'ll release a home video with \"Ambitions As A Rider,\" and a couple of the hardcore songs.  Sway: That\\'s my favorite one. That\\'s the one I listen to over- Track number one on the first disc. That\\'s my...  2Pac: I just did a remix to \"What\\'s Your Phone Number\" with all new lyrics. We took that MC Lyte beat from her new song she has out, \"Keep On Movin\\' Up.\" It\\'s so freaky you won\\'t believe it. I got a whole new album out, waiting for the sound track. It\\'s clean. All positive. All in the vein of songs like \\'Keep Your Head Up\\'. and \"Brenda\\'s Got A Baby\" It\\'s that type of stuff. I just put out a hardcore double album, and next I\\'m gonna put out an introspective album. It\\'ll be like a \"Me Against The World Pt. 2.\" That\\'s what I think my fans are looking for. I\\'m gonna show that I appreciate your support.  Sway: Ayy yo Pac, you gave a lot of love back to some Bay Area artists like E-40, 4Tay, you know, Dru Down and the whole crew. Talk about what made you decide to work with them.  2Pac: Because I can\\'t always be in the Bay. I know how the Bay is. The Bay is the type of place where if you ain\\'t there they\\'re gonna talk about you. I wanted them to know that I love you, I feel you and I\\'m gonna represent for you. I know I gotta a certain amount of acclaim so I bring the Bay with me. I know E-40 is what I was when I was with Digital Underground. He is the Bay right now. Him and 4Tay. So I get them on my album to represent the Bay. It shows we still have love and we\\'re still all good. By us being representatives we bring the Bay where ever we go. Rappin\\' 4Tay has always been raw to me and I like his style. When I was in jail I used to always listen to stuff so when I got out we clicked and did the song. Now he\\'s in jail and I gotta do what he did for me. When I was in jail he used to send out shout outs and show support, so now I support 4Tay. Everybody pray for him and send letters. I hope the brother gets out of jail as soon as possible. Rappin\\' 4Tay was released in July \\'96. You know, it\\'s a struggle for every young Black man. You know how it is. Only God can judge us.  Sway: Alright, let\\'s end it now. Yo, we been sitting here talking with 2Pac, and you know, like I said in the beginning of our conversation, I want to commend you on all your accomplishments and not only that. The fact that you\\'ve had all these obstacles and demons that you had to deal with, but for some reason, you know, you\\'ve been blessed enough to prevail. No matter what y\\'all believe or what you hear from the media, this brother got his head together and I have no doubt in my mind that he\\'s always gonna come out on top. And I appreciate you letting us come down here brother.  2Pac: I appreciate y\\'all givin\\' me the opportunity to clear all that stuff up, and I\\'ma always represent for y\\'all. I\\'m always gonna give you the opportunity to ask me whatever questions you want to ask me whatever way you want to ask without me trippin\\'. And on the same note, I want y\\'all always just- I give you the story now, it\\'s up to you. Because you are our reporters. It\\'s up to you to give it without putting me in jail with what I told you, you know what I mean. Without giving out the facts, it\\'s up to you to let the people know what\\'s really poppin\\'. What\\'s really goin\\' on.  Sway: So what we gonna do, we gonna play it back the way we recorded, the way you said it, you know? So it\\'ll be Tupac words, alright? Alright, thanks again man. Tupac Shakur, alright?  2Pac: Everybody\\'s taking their papers man.  (Man, man, man...)

He resisted and was shot five times. Left for dead, Tupac shocked the world by not only surviving, but checking out the hospital just days after the incident. Tupac was in New York filming a video as well as awaiting the fate of his trial for the sexual assault charges he was indicted for the year before. He would eventually be sentenced to four and a half years in prison. He would also accuse former rap partner Notorious B.I.G. as the person who set him up to be shot. It was these accusations that intensified the supposed East/West Coast rivalry within hip hop. Now just before Tupac began serving his sentence for sexual assault charges, he released his third album entitled Me Against The World. It was on this album the world heard Tupac\\'s tribute to his mom entitled \"Dear Mama.\" After serving a little more than seven months in New York\\'s correctional facilities, Tupac was released on 1.3 million dollars bail and signed to Death Row Records, the home to Snoop Dogg and Tha Dogg Pound. He quickly made noise with the release of his hit song \"California Love,\" a track featuring himself and Dr. Dre. While awaiting his appeal, Tupac released the double album All Eyez On Me. It featured all sorts of artists, ranging from R&B crooner Jodeci to Baby Area locals like Dru Down and Richie Rich. Ironically while out on bail, Tupac had managed to again embroil himself in controversy. He was arrested twice for parole violations and accused of causing a disturbance that took place at the Soul Train Music Awards. Reports confirmed that he confronted Notorious B.I.G. backstage. On September 7th, 1996, 2Pac and CEO of Death Row Suge Knight left the Mike Tyson-Bruce Seldon fight in Las Vegas in Suge\\'s car. A white Cadillac with four people inside pulled alongside at an intersection, and on person stepped out and opened fire. Tupac was hit four times while Suge escaped with minor injuries. Tupac was brought to the University Medical Center. On Friday, September 13, 1996, Tupac died after six days in critical condition. Tupac Shakur was pronounced dead at 4:03 PM. His body was later cremated. He was only 25.  (He was only 25, he was only 25, he was only 25, he was only 25, he was only 25, he was only 25, he was only 25, he was only 25, he was only 25, he was only 25...)

And all you other O.G.\\'s who go down; I don\\'t fear death     [Intro: Press Release] In today\\'s music news: the ever-controversial 2Pac Shakur has just released another album under the alias \"Makaveli.\" Music insiders are running wild trying to rearrange other artists\\' street dates in fear of a wipeout in retail inter-chart movement. Although no one knows the exact cause of the new album, resources tell me a number of less fortunate rappers have joined together in conspiracy to assassinate the character of not only Mr Shakur but of Death Row Records as well. Nas, the alleged ring leader, is furious at 2Pac\\'s – excuse me – Makaveli\\'s verbal assault on Mobb Sleep, Notorious P.I.G., and several other New York rappers. JAY-Z from \"Hawaiian Sophie\" fame, Big Little whatever, and several other corny-sounding motherfuckers are understandably shaken up by this release. The question everybody wants to know is: why\\'d they get this nigga started? 2Pac – rather Makaveli – was not available for comment but released this statement:  [Spoken: 2Pac] It\\'s not about East or West It\\'s about niggas and bitches Power and money, ridaz and punks Which side are you on? *Heartbeat* *Gunshots* *Encroaching footsteps* These niggas is still fuckin\\' talkin\\'?

(Dear Mama) Sweet lady, place no one above ya (You are appreciated) Sweet lady, don\\'t you know we love ya?

Tell me the answer Moms ignores me and avoids me like cancer Grow up rough and it\\'s hard to understand stuff Moms was tough cause his papa wasn\\'t man enough; Couldn\\'t stand up to his own responsibilities Instead of takin care of me, he\\'d rather live lavishly That\\'s why I\\'ll never be a father; Unless you got the time it\\'s a crime; don\\'t even bother That\\'s when I started hatin\\' the phony smiles Said I was an only child Look at mama\\'s lonely smile!

Walk blind into a line or fight? Fight and die if we must Die, like niggas  [Verse 1] This is for the masses, the lower classes The ones you left out, jobs were giving, better living But we were kept out Made to feel inferior, but we\\'re superior Break the chains in our brains that made us fear ya Pledge allegiance to a flag that neglects us Honour a man that that refuses to respect us Emancipation Proclamation? Please! Lincoln just said that to save the nation These are lies that we all accepted Say no to drugs but the governments\\' kept it Running through our community, killing the unity The war on drugs is a war on you and me And yet, they say this is the Home of The Free But if you ask me, it\\'s all about hypocrisy The constitution, yo, it don\\'t apply to me And Lady Liberty? Stupid bitch lied to me This made me strong, and no one\\'s gonna like what I\\'m pumpin\\' But its wrong to keep someone from learning something So get up, its time to start nation building I\\'m fed up, we gotta start teaching children That they can be all that they wanna to be There\\'s much more to life than just poverty  [Interlude] This is definitely uh... words of wisdom America! America!

[Verse 2] Words of Wisdom Based upon the strength of a nation Conquer the enemy armed with education Protect yourself, reach for what you want to do Know thyself, teach by what we\\'ve been through Armed with the knowledge of the place we\\'ve been No one will ever oppress this race again No Malcolm X in my history text, why\\'s that? ’Cause he tried to educate and liberate all blacks Why is Martin Luther King in my book each week? He told blacks, if they get smacked, turn the other cheek I don\\'t get it, so many questions went through my mind I get sweated, they act like asking questions is a crime But forget it, cause one day I\\'m gonna prove them wrong Not every brother had his mother on the welfare line The American Dream, though it seems like it\\'s attainable They\\'re pulling your sleeve, don\\'t believe ’Cause it will strangle ya Pulling the life of your brain, I can\\'t explain Beg as you can obtain from which you came You swear to your mother that you living in equality Forgetting your brother that\\'s living here in poverty Thought they had us beaten when they took out King But the battle ain\\'t over till the black man sings Words of Wisdom The battle ain\\'t over \\'till the black man sings Words of Wisdom  [Outro] NIGHTMARE!
