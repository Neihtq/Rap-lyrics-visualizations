<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<p align="center">

</p>

Rap is one of the four fundamental elements of Hip-Hop and has gained more popularity than ever since the beginning of this movement. However, this genre received lots of criticism from the media due to its often used aggressive language.

This criticism of the media has been always accompanying for years but now we Rap Music has reached a state where even rappers themselves criticize the current state of Rap. Eminem, one of the most famous and successful artist in this genre, released - without any indication or announcement - his 2018 surprise album 'Kamikaze'. Most of the tracks expresses his anger and discontent about the c urrent trends in Hip-Hop Music and he also makes fun and verbally attacks some other, younger Hip-Hop artists, that are currently trending.

Given the long history of Rap Music and how recent the aforementioned event is, one thoroughly consider whether the music itself, especially the text, has changed.

This Project scraped the lyrics from genius.com from 12 artists from different eras of Hip-Hop and analyzed them in terms of chosen words, statistics, sentiment and topics.

### Built With

This Project uses following libraries for Data Engineering, Analysis and Visualization:
* [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)

* [nltk](https://www.nltk.org/)
* [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)

Webscraping/Lyrics aqcuisition was done with these libraries:
